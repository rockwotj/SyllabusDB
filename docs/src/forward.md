Why write a book? And why on databases?

I think at first these questions weren't clear, but I think these concepts are important to be taught, 
so I thought I would try my hand at creating materials for a course on "Introduction to Database Internals".

My first job out of college was working on NoSQL databases at the tail end of when NoSQL was at the peek of 
popularity/hype. It was very exciting and fulfilling work, and I went from not really knowing a ton about
databases outside of the relational algebra that I was taught in CSSE 133 to being the main developer on the
query planner for a database that powered some of the largest apps in Google Cloud.

Since I've moved on from that I've taken with me a mentality and understanding of how database systems work.
Anytime I'm working with a database now I look at it from the lense of what the database system is doing under
the hood, and I feel like it's been very beneficial to me. Databases have so much applied computer science theory
and are a wonderful rabbit hole of tradeoffs and design desisions. They are (in my opinion) systems that should be
studied by all students.

Additionally, I just haven't been able to find concise material on databases that are approachable for beginners.
My hope is that this book can help people understand these sytems and get a peek at how things work under the hood.
Not all database systems work the same, and some make different tradeoffs - my personal take on databases is probably
evident to the seasoned database user who reads this book. Reguardless I hope this is useful material and at the very
least is a very exciting topic for me to write about.
